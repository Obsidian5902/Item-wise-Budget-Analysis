# Item-wise-Budget-Analysis
In this project, We basically analyse the data of budget from excel into powerBi and made a decent dashboard with some visualization tools of powerBi, such as: cards, pie charts, column charts, tables etc.

Steps: -
1. First, we transform the data into PowerBI from Excel, and after cleaning it, we apply it to PowerBI.
2. Then come to the next part, which is canvas. In canvas, we generally make text for our dashboard title.
3. After that, we put a background image on the canvas related to the budget.
4. According to the Excel data, I made three matrices and two cards.
5. Below are the are the matrices and cards, a pie chart, and one column chart for further analysis.
6. At the end, we used the dax function to calculate the total amount used in it.
