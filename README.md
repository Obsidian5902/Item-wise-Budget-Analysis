# Item-wise-Budget-Analysis
In this project, We basically analyse the data of budget from excel into powerBi and made a decent dashboard with some visualization tools of powerBi, such as: cards, pie charts, column charts, tables etc.

Steps: -
1. First we transform the data into powerBi from excel and after cleaning it apply it to the powerBi
2. Then come to the next part which is canvas, in the canvas we generally made text for our dashboard title.
